			so this is how it is.
			sign up for a github account. 
			download github for windows or mac.
			clone the Butler-I3D-Club repository to your computer.
				this will ask you where you want to save it - this will be your project folder.

			you have set up github.
			DON'T start editing the master branch.
			DO make your own branch and edit inside of it - your folder will update to hold the contents of your branch.
